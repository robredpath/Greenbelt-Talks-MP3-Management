This is the order processing system for Greenbelt Festival's Talks Team.

Prerequisites:-

LWP
CGI
Digest::MD5

Installation:- 
Copy gb_talks.conf to somewhere non-world-readable, make it readable by your web server and set it up as you want. 
We recommend that these scripts be executed as as reduced-privilege user. 
Create a database - setup_scripts/ should create the correct schema for the latest version of the scripts


Inputs:-

Individual orders for mp3s - Web page, orders.plx
HQ mp3 files - Web page, upload_talk.plx

Processing:-
Transcode to LQ mp3 - Cron script, transcode_queue_runner.plx

Outputs:-
Upload LQ mp3s to website - Cron script, upload_queue_runner.plx
Make repo of LQ mp3s available to duplication team - this is currently handled by a local SMB share

State reporting
- Generally, scripts should set $0 to their talk ID

Logging - directly to filesystem
- Upload queue runner log - upload_log
- Transcode queue runner log - transcode_log

TODO:-

- Add support for boundary conditions
 - Talk not recorded - ensure that this doesn't hold up MP3 orders but alert users to failure
 - Talk chase - on upload page, ask why talks over x hours old haven't been uploaded yet
 - Identify orders for talks that are not available so that appropriate action can be taken
 - Suspend talk from sale affects both website and local MP3 orders (or make it toggle-able).
 - Wrong track has been uploaded / track has been uploaded with incorrect ID
- Add proper box set support
- Add conf options for directories 
- Add confirmation stage to upload to avoid mistakes
- Add sanity checking to upload page - has a talk finished yet?
- Add 'replace' checkbox to upload page
- Add authentication
- Add more state support to admin functions
