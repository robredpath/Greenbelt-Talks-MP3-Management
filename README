- Generally, scripts should set $0 to their talk ID

Logging - directly to filesystem

- Transcode queue runner log - transcode_log

TODO:-

- Add support for boundary conditions
 - Talk not recorded - ensure that this doesn't hold up MP3 orders but alert users to failure
 - Talk chase - on upload page, ask why talks over x hours old haven't been uploaded yet
 - Identify orders for talks that are not available so that appropriate action can be taken
 - Suspend talk from sale affects both website and local MP3 orders (or make it toggle-able).
 - Wrong track has been uploaded / track has been uploaded with incorrect ID
- Add proper box set support
- Add time support
	- Don't allow talks to be uploaded that haven't finished yet
	- Warn if a talk has been pending for more than 4 hours after it's finished
- Add 'replace' checkbox to upload page
