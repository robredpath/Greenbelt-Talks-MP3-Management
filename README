This is the order processing system for Greenbelt Festival's Talks Team.

Installation:- Copy gb_talks.conf to /etc and make it readable by the appropriate users. We recommend that these scripts be executed as as reduced-priviledge user. TODO: automate this with GNU make. Trying to run these scripts on a Windows system would be foolish.

Inputs:-
The list of talks for the festival - CSV file, parse_talks.plx
Individual orders for mp3s - Web page, orders.plx
HQ mp3 files - Web page, upload_talk.plx

Processing:-
Transcode to LQ mp3 - Cron script, transcode_queue_runner.plx

Outputs:-
Admin function - admin.plx
Upload LQ mp3s to website - Cron script, upload_queue_runner.plx
Make repo of LQ mp3s available to duplication team - this is currently handled by a local SMB share

State reporting
- Generally, scripts should set $0 to their talk ID

Logging
- Upload queue runner log - upload.log
- Transcode queue runner log - transcode.log
