This is the order processing system for Greenbelt Festival's Talks Team.

Installation:- Copy gb_talks.conf to /etc and make it readable by the appropriate users. We recommend that these scripts be executed as as reduced-priviledge user. TODO: automate this with GNU make. Trying to run these scripts on a Windows system would be foolish.
