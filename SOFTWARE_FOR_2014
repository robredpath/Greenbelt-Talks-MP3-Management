Write two bits of software 

- an Excel spreadsheet parser (probably actually CSV) from the talks list leaflet
> Read in
> Parse dates/location field
> Store in db

- an app to automatically assign recording people to talks based on alphabetical ordering

- an app to produce a web page for the rota, displaying talks, grouped by time slots
